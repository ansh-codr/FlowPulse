  "description": "FlowPulse is a Supabase-powered productivity tracker that combines a Chrome extension for activity capture, a realtime analytics dashboard, and serverless Supabase Edge Functions for ingestion and summarization. The stack avoids any self-hosted services: the dashboard deploys to Netlify, the backend lives entirely in Supabase, and the browser extension syncs directly to Supabase APIs.",
